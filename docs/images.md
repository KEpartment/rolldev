# Docker Images

Each of the docker images used by RollDev environments are published on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR): [https://ghcr.io/epartment/rolldev](https://ghcr.io/epartment/rolldev). Source files used to build these images may be found in the `images` directory of the main project repository. Github Actions are used to automatically build and push new images to GHCR when image sources are modified. Please refer to the repositories on GHCR for a list of available image versions and tags.
